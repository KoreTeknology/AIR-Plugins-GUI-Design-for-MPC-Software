Combine them for a massive sonic experience to liven up even the most thrilling music production. AIR Solina also includes the new Flavor section for added texture and color to its sound. Also built-in is a wide array of effects including Delay, Reverb, and Chorus. AIR Solina is the sound designers dream with no shortage of knobs to twist and turn for incredibly unique keyboard tones. | <img src="https://github.com/KoreTeknology/Godot-toolbox-for-developers/blob/master/Documentation/images/screen.png">
