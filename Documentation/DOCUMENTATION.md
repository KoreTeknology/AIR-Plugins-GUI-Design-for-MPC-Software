The AIR Solina Plugin is based on the classic 6-timbre polyphonic keyboard instrument featuring Contrabass, Cello, Viola, Violin, Trumpet and Horn selections with independent volume, pan and pitch control. Combine them for a massive sonic experience to liven up even the most thrilling music production. AIR Solina also includes the new Flavor section for added texture and color to its sound. Also built-in is a wide array of effects including Delay, Reverb, and Chorus. AIR Solina is the sound designers dream with no shortage of knobs to twist and turn for incredibly unique keyboard tones. | <img src="images/mpc-plugins-effects-solina-img.png">
