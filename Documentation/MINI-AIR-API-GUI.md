This document presents the keys and values associated with the interactive components of the user interfaces of AIR plugins, present in the latest versions of Akai MPC software. You will find here all the reference information to develop your own graphic themes.

## General structure

All pluginÂ´s themes are constructed in the same way, thanks to a list of references (parameters) and a list of components (controls). Each plugin then has a JSON file which links these elements. let's start to see the list of parameters accessible for the plugins that interest us here (Solina, Hype, Drumsynth):
