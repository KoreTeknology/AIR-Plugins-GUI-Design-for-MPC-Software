### A Collection of GUI Redesign for AIR Instruments/Fx Plugins, used in Akai MPC Softwares

The aim of this project is to serve a serie of new "Design" for the [**AIR Audio Plugins**](https://www.airmusictech.com/) included into the latest release of Akai *MPC Software 2x*. If you don´t know about this DAW, i invite you to go and visit their site: [**Akaipro.com**](https://www.akaipro.com/mpc-software). 
The new themes packages will be distributed and available as **FREE Download** on our [Facebook Fans Page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2455369201273499), stay tuned for more to come... 

This project is all about distributing new theme packages that contains a set of graphics files and XML files which allows a **redesign of the plugins** supplied with the MPC software of the famous **Akai** brand. Each plugins is built from a base, the background and elements such as faders, knobs, and other controllers. The XML file contains all the information about the placement of these elements on the surface of the user interface. You will find in this project several files and documents. From there you can **download** the files for your plugin OR/AND **learn** from the tutorials how to do your own theme.

## History

I started to develop user interfaces for audio products in the years 2001, for physical machines as well as for virtual machines. I have been a programmer and musician since very young and all my energy is professionally oriented to satisfy users in the handling of their work or entertainment tools. I participate in several software research and development groups of which this page is a recent production section. I am a fan of the products distributed by the company InMusicBrands which distributes among other things the Akai brand all over the world. In 2020, I acquired the MPC software 2 software, an overpowering DAW that uses the logic of the sampler sequencer of the same name. Since that time, I have modified most of the theme files supplied with the software, in order to personalize my instruments and effects.

Since the release of version 2.10, new instruments have been added to the existing list and the instruments really deserve special attention, mainly for the very good quality audio engines, the functions offered in quantity and ... ergonomics. which was not really adapted to users and their requirements. I must say that after analyzing the code of the themes and the images provided, I understand that the design of the plugins was not a priority for the development group, it is basic, poorly organized and the visuals are poor, but it is simply my professional opinion in this area. Overall, I appreciate the design that Akai provides in its consumer products.

So I decided to distribute and update my themes for the new instruments as well as for some elements of the main software interface. They are therefore offered free of charge to all, in exchange for accepting the license. Be sure to read it before clicking the download button, as it commits you to preserving the content and making it free for everyone.

Enjoy!
