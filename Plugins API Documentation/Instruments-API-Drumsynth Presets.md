# Drumsynth Presets

## Introduction

The Drum Synth includes several tools to create your own **drum kits**. We have the the Multi synth, a multi-sound generator to create up to 8 sounds of any categories and get them available on the 8 first pads. It has several dedicated Fx, as well as an overall Send Fx. Each instrument has a set of specific parameters, depending on the model type*. It also offers velicity and velocity % targets selection. We also have a dedicated generator for each category. The GUI may differ from versions and releases and a set of **presets** are available for each instrument plugin. In this documentation, we will see how the presests are made.
